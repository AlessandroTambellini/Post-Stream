"nix is very close to the final linux form.\n\nIt keeps delighting me.\n\nWith nix you get a feeling that when it’s done it’s done.","Nop, I don't get it. What does it mean practically?","Suppose you need to go in production right now. Your system has lots of moving parts and different languages and libraries.\n\nnix develop: you work and you try things. You also do so on several different parts.

If all sibling items have the same flex grow factor, then all items will receive the same share of remaining space. The common practice is to set flex-grow: 1, but setting the flex grow factor for all the flex items to 88, 100, 1.2, or any other value greater than 0 will produce the same result: the value is a ratio.\n\n","","","","","","            ","            ","            ","            ","            ","            ","            ","            ","            ","            ","            ","            ","c"," ","j","sd","message.","message.","m nsm","m nsm","sd","mb","mbllkj","lksjdl sd","lksjdl sd","kkjh","ciao","ciao","ciao","kjad kdj la lkad\nkjadf lkd\nladk\n\n\n\nadlkf lakdj lksad lkd.","kajds","cad","df              fd","ciao\n\nhello","ciao    hello","cioa    hello","ciao\n\nhello","ciao   \n\nhello","ciao     hello"

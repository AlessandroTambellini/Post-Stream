# Letter Stream
There are two actions you can perform in this website:
1) Share a letter and wait for a reply in your email box.
2) Reply to other letters.

## Note:
1) The letters, as shown in the stream, are anonymous.
2) The replies are sent directly to the email box of the author of the letter and aren't stored in the database.

## What's Next
1) Connect with an email API provider to:
    1) Verify the email of whoever wants to upload a letter. And possibly enable the possibily to delete a letter via auth.
    2) Send the reply to the recipient

## Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
The database will be created automatically on first run.

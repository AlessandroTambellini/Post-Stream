# Post Stream
It is basically a website where posts are shared anonymously and they can receive replies,
but the replies are only visible to the author of the post. 

## Setup
Node.js version used: `v22.14.0`

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
The database will be created automatically on first run.

## Map of the website
